#Trade WordPress theme and the Et Al WordPress plugin.

The *trader* theme is incredibly basic and only contains the bare minimum of pages needed to test the *et al* plugin.

*et al* is a plugin that allows a user to add multiple authors to a post.
It only works on posts, and the only option given will be users that are set specifically as 'authors' within their user settings.

The plugin will add the selected user(s) name, gravata, and link to their author page at the bottom of the post.

Styling can be handled on a theme by theme basis. The *trader* theme does have built-in styling for the plugin.

Code Sniffer was used to lint the code according to wordpress coding standards.

WordPress Coding Standards were downloaded from git repo:
